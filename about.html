    Is a group project, based in Nairobi that supports adults with disabilities. The project is an Art and Craft-based
    based, that is centered in improving and increasing the neurological and motor functions such as muscle coordination of
    persons with disabilities. The group is focused on a rehabilitation process for persons with cerebral palsy, autism, and
    polio disabilities.

    The group meet-ups are held on weekends where projects are laid out, tasks delegated, and activities are run. It's with this that I welcome the team.
